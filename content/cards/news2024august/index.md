We are pleased to announce the release of TIBS-R V3.0. This upgrade of the Temporal Interference Brain Stimulator for Research (TIBS-R) improves the accuracy of the currents in the presence of large variations in electrode contacts and further reduces second-order intermodulation products (IM2). When used in conjunction with our electroencephalography (EEG) {{< modal-link EEG-Filters >}}filter solution{{< /modal-link >}}, IM2 products are reduced to well below the EEG noise floor, allowing artifact-free recordings during stimulating. This opens up new possibilities for closed-loop EEG-based stimulation protocols. A wireless charging option extends TIBS-R's operating time, e.g., for overnight experiments.

TIBS-R is certified for electrical safety according to IEC 60601-1:2005 + A1:2012 + A2:2020 and designed to meet the needs of rigorous, innovative, and advanced research. It consists of a high-precision, broadband-intelligent current source, an electrode connection box, and hardware-based input and output interfaces. The Python and MATLAB-compatible application programming interface allows the creation of complex stimulation protocols, as well as integration with EEG and other equipment for sophisticated experimental setups.

Version 3.0 of the TI Planning tool, a computational online tool designed to simplify the optimization of targeted TI neurostimulation protocols for the TIBS-R device, will soon be released. This update offers easy-to-apply personalization of stimulation using a novel AI segmentation implementation of magnetic resonance imaging data that has been specifically developed for TI.
