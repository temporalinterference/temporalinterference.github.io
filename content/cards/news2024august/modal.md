# TIBS-R V3.0 – Leading Stimulator Performance for Artifact-free EEG and Closed-Loop Protocols

TIBS-R V3.0 has been released! The device is certified for electrical safety according to IEC 60601-1:2005 + A1:2012 + A2:2020 and has several important enhancements

• Improved performance in the presence of large variations in electrode contact quality

• Markedly reduced second-order intermodulation products (IM2); when paired with the IT’IS electroencephalography (EEG) filter solution, IM2 products are reduced to well below the EEG noise floor (<30nV)

• New possibilities for EEG-based closed-loop stimulation protocols

• New wireless charging option that extends stimulator run time, e.g., for overnight experiments

• This update will be made available immediately to all researchers in our Early Adopter Program.
