TI Solutions is dedicated to advancing research into TI-based applications. Through our Early Adopter Program (EAP), we are bringing together a select group of researchers interested in leveraging our investigational TI stimulation device for their studies. The EAP aims to foster exploration of TI's potential by enabling precise and flexible stimulation capabilities.

Participating researchers will have the opportunity to use our investigational device in their *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies, contributing to the growing knowledge base in this field. In return, TI Solutions will gain valuable insights into the needs of the research community, driving the development and refinement of future device specifications.
