The EAP will play a pivotal role in fostering exploration of the potential of TI through flexible and highly controlled stimulations. Groups participating in the EAP will be able to use our investigational device in their research projects, enabling them to advance the existing knowledge base through in vitro and in vivo studies. In turn, TI Solutions will gain insights into the researchersâ€™ needs, which will help drive development and optimization of the specifications for future devices.
