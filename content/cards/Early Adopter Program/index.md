id: early-adopter-program

TI Solutions aims to facilitate research into TI-based applications. We are pulling together a select group of researchers as part of our Early Adopter Program who are interested in applying our investigational TI stimulation device as part of their research studies.
The EAP will play a pivotal role in fostering exploration of the potential of TI through flexible and highly controlled stimulations. Groups participating in the EAP will be able to use our investigational device in their research projects, enabling them to advance the existing knowledge base through *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies. In turn, TI Solutions will gain insights into the researchersâ€™ needs, which will help drive development and optimization of the specifications for future devices.
