# Early Adopter Program

## How can I become part of the EAP?

Researchers interested in participating in TI Solutions’ EAP should contact us to arrange a conference call for initial discussion before submitting a written proposal. Proposals will be evaluated by our review board for the scientific significance, topicality, originality, and feasibility of the project. Projects that are approved by the board enter the EAP.

Note that each study admitted to the program must provide proof that the study has gained ethics approval from the appropriate regulatory institution as a prerequisite for receiving the TI stimulation device for the proposed research project.

The TI devices are continuously improved and their functions extended. Groups that are part of the EAP can lease a 8-channel device for CHF 500 / month; maintenance and support is included in the lease price. Options for MRI-compatibility, additional hardware for EEG compatibilty and for continuous operation using wireless power transfer are available upon special request. The minimal lease period is six months.

## Additional Services

The IT’IS Foundation offers specialized services for the development of experiment-specific graphical user interfaces to support TI planning and simulations and provides guidance on research protocols and experimental design as needed.
