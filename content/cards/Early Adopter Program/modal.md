# Early Adopter Program

## How can I become part of the EAP?

Researchers interested in joining our Early Adopter Program are encouraged to contact us to schedule a preliminary conference call. Following this discussion, a short written proposal needs to be submitted for consideration. Proposals will be reviewed by our board based on their scientific significance, relevance, originality, and feasibility. Approved projects will then officially enter the EAP.

Please note that all studies admitted to the program must provide proof of ethics approval from the relevant regulatory institution. This is a mandatory requirement before the TI stimulation device can be provided for the proposed research project.

The TI devices are under continuous development, with ongoing improvements and feature expansions. EAP participants have the opportunity to lease an 8-channel device for CHF 500/month, with maintenance and support included in the lease price. Additional options, such as MRI compatibility, hardware for EEG integration, and continuous operation via wireless power transfer, are available upon special request. The minimum lease period is six months.

## Additional Services

The ITâ€™IS Foundation offers specialized services for the development of experiment-specific graphical user interfaces to support TI planning and simulations and provides guidance on research protocols and experimental design as needed.
