Our partner, the ITâ€™IS Foundation, has released a new filter solution that allows uncompromised concurrent high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recording during closed-loop temporal interference stimulation with our TIBS-R system. Filters are available for 128 and 256 channel Electrical Geodesics, Inc. (EGI) EEG systems and 32-channel modules are available for the systems of BrainProducts.
