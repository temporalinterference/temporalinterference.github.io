While the applied frequencies of the electric fields themselves are too high to induce neural firing, the frequency of the envelop can drive neural activity. This new concept holds great promise for both research and clinics as it may open up new experimental opportunities and may be used for selective deep brain stimulation to treat certain disorders without the necessity of surgically implanting electrodes within certain brain areas, which is still common practice today.
