# The Growing Global Burden of Brain Diseases

Brain diseases are increasing worldwide due to demographic shifts, population growth, and longer lifespans, with their global economic impact estimated to exceed $5 trillion. These conditions encompass neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke, mental health challenges like depression and anxiety, and neurological conditions including epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Other categories include brain tumors, traumatic brain injuries, infectious diseases like meningitis, developmental and genetic disorders, autoimmune and metabolic diseases, as well as neuropsychiatric and functional neurological conditions.

## Challenges in Treating Brain Disorders

Invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) with implanted electrodes is used as a treatment for severe movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease. While effective, the risks of brain surgery limit the exploration of alternative brain targets and restrict the potential for broader therapeutic applications.

## Advancing Non-Invasive Neuromodulation

Neuromodulation offers a promising non-pharmacological treatment by directly regulating abnormal neural activity underlying various brain disorders. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) have been widely used in research and clinical settings. However, their ability to reach deeper brain structures often comes at the cost of stronger stimulation to the overlying cortex, increasing the risk of unintended side effects near safety thresholds.

## Novelty 

Temporal interference bridges the gap between classical NIBS technologies and DBS: it enables non- or minimally invasive, steerable stimulation of deep brain structures. This new methods paves the way for a transformative treatment strategy for a wide range of brain disorders, opening new possibilities for safe, effective, and patient-centered therapies.
