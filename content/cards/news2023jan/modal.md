# TIBS-R and TIBS-R-MRI - The Ultimate in Technology for TI

After exactly 3 years of intense collaboration with [Z43 partners](https://z43.swiss), we have completed the development of our Temporal Interference Brain Stimulator for Research (TIBS-R).

Today, we release Version 1.02, which will be demonstrated next week at NANS2023 in Las Vegas. The design of the device and the maximally flexible software are optimized for advanced TI brain stimulation research. We look forward to engaging with those research groups who will receive devices through our Early Adopter Program, and we will continue working to optimize the device to facilitate the most advanced TI research.
