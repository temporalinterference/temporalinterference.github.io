# TI-EEG Filter Solutions

## EEG Filter Solutions of the IT'IS Foundation
The unique TI Filter Solutions for TIBS-R of the IT'IS Foundation [IT'IS Foundation](https://itis.swiss) allow for artifact-free concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recording during temporal interference (TI) stimulation in the 2 – 50 kHz frequency range.

## High-Pass Filter

The 8-channel passive current mode high-pass filter (HPF-8) is positioned between the Electrode Connection Box and the stimulation electrodes to further reduce the low frequency components and noise generated by the Intelligent Current Source (ICS), while preserving the TI stimulation currents. For typical use cases, 2nd order intermodulation (IM2) products are attenuated below 30 nVrms.

## Low-Pass Filter

The low pass filter (LPF) is placed between the EEG recording electrodes and the EEG amplifier. It is engineered to prevent TI carrier signals from causing compression or intermodulation distortion in the EEG amplifier. The active 7th-order, ultra-low noise, ultra-low distortion design provides a flat response up to 90 Hz, while attenuating carrier signals of 1 kHz and higher by >130 dB. Each EEG channel has its own filter, referenced to the COM / GND electrode of the EEG cap.
