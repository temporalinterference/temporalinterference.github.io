# EEG Filters

Many research groups are eager to explore closed-loop temporal interference stimulation studies. To meet this need, TI Solutions offers state-of-the-art filter solutions developed by the IT'IS Foundation, enabling artifact-free concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during stimulation with TIBS-R.

Provided are a high-pass filter and a low-pass filter designed for use with passive EEG electrodes. 2nd-order intermodulation products (IM2) remain under 30 nVrms at 2 mA. The detailed specifications are available here. (ADD FLYER)

The filters are currently available for either 128 or 256 channels EEG systems manufactured by Electrical Geodesics, Inc., and 32-channel stackable modules are available for the systems of BrainProducts. Solutions for additional systems can be provided upon special request.
