In a recent paper published in Brain Stimulation, the use of non-invasive temporal interference (TI) stimulation for epilepsy therapy was investigated across carrier frequencies ranging from 1 to 9 kHz. Computational modeling with the {{< modal-link TIP >}}TI Planning Tool and Sim4Lilfe{{< /modal-link >}} was employed to optimize stimulation parameters for maximal selectivity and strength in the hippocampus, and exposure predictions were validated using *in vivo* stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data. TI stimulation, but not high-frequency sham stimulation, successfully reached the hippocampus and significantly reduced epileptic biomarkers, with effects persisting beyond the stimulation period. The use of 9 kHz high-frequency carriers induced less off-target neuromodulation than 1 kHz and effectively avoided cortical effects.

The study results suggest a possible pathway toward a non-invasive option for patients who are medication-resistant or inoperable. They also add to the growing evidence that TI stimulation can effectively target deep brain regions, and that high-frequency carriers can do so without affecting the overlying cortical structures or causing noticeable sensations.

Our {{< modal-link TIBS-R-system >}}TIBS-R system{{< /modal-link >}} is designed to allow any TI variants, including 8 fully differential, synchronized channels and frequencies from direct current (DC) up to 100 kHz.
