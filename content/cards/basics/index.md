TI involves the application of two or more high-frequency electrical currents (typ. >1kHz), which individually do not effectively stimulate neurons due to their high frequency.

When these high-frequency currents intersect in the brain, they create a low-frequency interference pattern (beat frequency) that modulates neuron activity.
