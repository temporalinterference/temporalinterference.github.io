# Introducing TIP V4.0 – Fully Automated and Smarter Than Ever

The latest version of our powerful TI stimulation planning tool brings major innovations to researchers worldwide:

* Automated Personalization: Our deep-learning model now automatically detects anatomical fiducials for consistent 10-10 electrode placement—no manual steps required
  
* New Optimization Engine: The surrogate-model-based (SuMo) optimizer uses artificial intelligence (AI) to explore the full electrode configuration space, delivering better results faster
  
* Speed and Performance Gains: Optimization is now twice as fast on average, with improved solution quality
  
* Improved Workflow: From drag-and-drop model upload to streamlined analysis, TIP V4.0 is more intuitive than ever
