# TIBS-R MRI Filter Solutions Installed

The new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Filter Solutions that enable temporal interference (TI) stimulation with our TIBS-R device during scanning in 2.9, 3.0, and 7.0 T MRI systems, have been successfully deployed in two leading research laboratories. Several other installations are underway.

We thank the IT’IS Foundation for applying their vast expertise in MRI safety to deliver these solutions to research groups enrolled in our Early Adopter Program.

More information about the TI-MRI Filter Solutions is available here.
