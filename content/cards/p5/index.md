title: TIBS-R V3.0: Leading Stimulator Performance for Artifact-free EEG and Closed-Loop Protocols
---
TIBS-R V3.0 has been released! The device is certified for electrical safety according to 

Improved performance in the presence of large variations in electrode contact quality
Markedly reduced second-order intermodulation products (IM2); when paired with the ITâ€™IS electroencephalography (EEG) filter solution, IM2 products are reduced to well below the EEG noise floor (<30nV)
New possibilities for EEG-based closed-loop stimulation protocols
New wireless charging option that extends stimulator run time, e.g., for overnight experiments
This update will be made available immediately to all researchers in our Early Adopter Program.
