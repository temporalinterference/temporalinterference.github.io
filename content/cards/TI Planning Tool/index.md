The TI planning tool (TIP) is provided by the ITâ€™IS Foundation for the optimization of electrode placements on human and animal subjects, currents and modulations. The tools are user-friendly and present results in a powerful visualization. Users can also define different optimization criteria. Thanks to a state-of-the-art cloud-based modeling platform, simulations of complex and realistic setups can be performed without special software or hardware. Version 2.2 supports two channel configurations, and phase modulation and multi-channel target optimization. Version 3.0 will add personalized modeling, allowing modeling of any anatomy and any electrode shape and placement.
