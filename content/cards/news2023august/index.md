title: TIBS-R V2.0 – Phase Modulation for Shaping Interference

Aug 03, 2023

We are pleased to announce the release of TIBS-R V2.0! This upgrade of our temporal interference (TI) system offers an important new feature, i.e., multi-channel phase modulation. This allows researchers to generate complex modulation waveforms inside the brain where the different currents overlap, for a wider range of experimental possibilities. Also included in the upgrade are improvements in the device’s reliability and stability.

Designed to meet the needs of rigorous research, TIBS-R V2.0 consists of a high-precision broadband intelligent current source (ICS), electrode connection box (ECB), and hardware-based in- and output interfaces. Built on the existing Python and MatLab-compatible application programming interface, V2.0 supports a diverse range of experimental protocols. The next version of the online [TI Planning tool](https://itis.swiss/tools-and-systems/ti-planning/) TIP V2.0 – developed by our partner, the IT'IS Foundation, specifically for TIBS-R V2.0 – supports all of the new features of TIBS-R V2.0 and reduces optimization of targeted neurostimulation protocols to three simple steps.
