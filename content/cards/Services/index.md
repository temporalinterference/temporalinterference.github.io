Our team will provide all engineering services required for the optimal application of the developed TI devices and planning tools, such as troubleshooting support, replacement of defective devices, and repairs. We are happy to contribute to drafting research proposals and to perform simulations for the TI planning if required. We are also interested in discussing and, if feasible, incorporating additional features into our devices and software tools.
