For groups enrolled in the Early Adopter Program, our team of experts is dedicated to ensuring the optimal use of our TIBS-R device. We provide comprehensive engineering support during the lease period, including troubleshooting, device replacement, and repairs.

In addition, the [ITâ€™IS Foundation](https://www.itis.swiss/) scientific team can support researchers in developing experiment-specific graphical user interfaces, as well as provide additional services such as personalization and optimization of TI stimulation through simulations and the dedicated TI planning tool. These services need to be budgeted separately from the device costs.
