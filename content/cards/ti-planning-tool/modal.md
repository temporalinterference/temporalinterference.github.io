# Precise TI Stimulation with TIP and Sim4Life

## The Challenges
The shape of the human heads and its dielectric properties vary and are non-homogeneous and also non-isotropic, presenting challenges in achieving the desired interference in the target tissues, i.e., the desired modulation in the target and non-or low modulation in the off-target regions. This requires highly accurate current sources, careful meticulous planning, and robust tools for interpreting results and assessing stimulation sensitivities on tissue parameter variations. The same challenges are valid for in vivo experiments. 

## Our Solution
