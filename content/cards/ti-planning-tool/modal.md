# Precise TI Stimulation with TIP and Sim4Life

## The Challenges

The shape of the human head and its dielectric properties are highly variable, non-homogeneous, and non-isotropic, posing significant challenges in achieving the desired interference patterns in target tissues while ensuring minimal or no modulation in off-target regions. Overcoming these complexities requires highly accurate current sources, meticulous planning, and robust tools for interpreting results and assessing stimulation sensitivities to tissue parameter variations. These challenges are equally relevant for *in vivo* experiments. 

## Our Solution

The synergy between the Temporal Interference Planning (TIP) tool and the computational platform Sim4Life provides researchers with the most advanced solution to master these challenges. By combining TIP’s intuitive protocol design with Sim4Life’s cutting-edge simulation and analysis capabilities, they empower researchers to efficiently develop, optimize, and validate TI protocols with unmatched precision.
