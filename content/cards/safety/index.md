# Ensuring Safety in Next-Generation Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is rapidly transforming the landscape of neurological and psychiatric treatments<sup>1</sup>. In particular, temporal interference stimulation (TIS), introduced in 2017, allows for targeted neuromodulation of deep brain structures<sup>2</sup>. However, two critical questions arise: First, what are the fundamental safety boundaries for TIS? And second, how can we ensure safety for the growing population of patients with conductive implanted medical devices that may distort and/or amplify the electric (E-) fields induced by NIBS?

The team of TI Solutions partner, the [ITâ€™IS Foundation](www.itis.swiss), has tackled these questions head-on through a series of investigations described in three recent scientific publications that combine advanced computational modeling and experimental validation to probe NIBS safety. The first two articles are companion papers in which quantitative guidelines for the safe application of TIS<sup>3,4</sup> are proposed, while the second is an assessment of NIBS safety in the presence of conductive implants<sup>5</sup>.
