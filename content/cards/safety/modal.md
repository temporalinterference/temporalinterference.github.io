Image: Simulated steady-state temperature increase distributions for DBS and tES. Input current of 1 mA, bipolar electrode configuration (top-left) with various electrode sizes. Heating is principally localized near the electrodes, such that brain heating is minimal for tES. In all cases, heating is well below published thresholds for direct tissue damage.
