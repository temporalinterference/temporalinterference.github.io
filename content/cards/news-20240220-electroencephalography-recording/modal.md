# {{< hyphen mobile >}}Electro&shy;ence&shy;phalo&shy;graphy Recording during TI Stimulation{{< /hyphen >}}

Many research groups would like to perform closed-loop temporal interference stimulation studies. Our partner, the IT’IS Foundation, has developed brand new filters specifically for the our TIBS-R device that allow uncompromised high-density encephalogram (EEG) recordings during stimulation.

Unlike other brain stimulation modalities, high-frequency temporal interference (TI) stimulation in principle allows for recording of an EEG during stimulation – provided that the TI device does not generate intermodulation voltages and high-order filters are used between the EEG electrodes and the EEG recording system – opening up the possibility for researchers to monitor stimulation response and investigate new closed-loop stimulation strategies that were previously not possible.

IT'IS, in collaboration with Nir Grossman’s group at Imperial College London, developed high-end battery-powered active filters. A low-pass filter – designed for use with passive EEG electrodes – for either 128 or 256 channels has been built for the high-density EEG systems manufactured by Electrical Geodesics, Inc. (EGI), and 32-channel modules are available for the systems of BrainProducts. In addition, a passive high-pass filter for each of the 8 stimulation channels of the TIBS-R device, was developed to suppress low frequency noise and any low-level intermodulation.

The new filter solution has been extensively tested in collaboration with the University Hospitals of Zurich.
