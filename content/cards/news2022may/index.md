After nearly two years of intense collaboration with the [IT’IS Foundation](https://itis.swiss/s/news-events/news/latest-news), we have completed the prototype development of our Temporal Interference Brain Stimulator for Research (TIBS-R).

The final prototype exists in two variants: a standard configuration (TIBS-R) and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible configuration (TIBS-R-MRI). Both variants consist of the battery-powered Intelligent Current Source (ICS) with eight fully differential channels that can be connected to any third-party electrodes via an Electrode Connection Box (ECB). It is controlled via the Application Programming Interface sent by a computer via optical connections.

The ICS and its external components make TIBS-R/TIBS-R-MRI the most flexible instrument for performing advanced TI research. It allows for millions of different stimulation scenarios in the lab or during functional MRI scans.
