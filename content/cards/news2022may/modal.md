# TIBS-R & TIBS-R-MRI - Final Prototype of New TI Technology

Today, TI Solutions released a demo of the final prototype device for advanced research in temporal interference brain stimulation. The device, developed in collaboration with the IT’IS Foundation, delivers high-precision current on eight channels from 0 Hz to 100 kHz. In the next few weeks the team will finalize the documentation, obtain electrical safety certification, and define the end-to-end testing protocol to be applied for each device. In parallel, the IT’IS Foundation will be completing an example of the control and monitoring software and the TI planning tool.
