# Bioelectromagnetics "Special Issue" on Neurostimulation

The journal Bioelectromagnetics has launched its first “Special Issue”, with this inaugural edition focused on the dynamic and rapidly advancing field of neurostimulation. Among the featured contributions are two notable publications, authored in collaboration with our team and other institutions, offering valuable quantitative guidance on exposure limits and broader safety considerations.

The majority of the publications are available via open access – please check the Bioelectromagnetics [website](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)1521-186X.Neurostimulation).
