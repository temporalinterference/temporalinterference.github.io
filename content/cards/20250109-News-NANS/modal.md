# TI Solutions and ZMT Exhibit at NANS 2025

TI Solutions and [Z43](https://z43.swiss) partner [ZMT](https://zmt.swiss) are excited to present their latest products for optimized targeted neuromodulation at the upcoming [North American Neuromodulation Society 28th Annual Meeting (NANS)](https://www.neuromodulation.org/annual-meeting.html) in Orlando, Florida, USA, January 30 – February 1, 2025.

Join us at Booth #445 for a demonstration of
- the TIBS-R V3.2 neuromodulation device, now with enhanced trigger functionality, enabling delivery of arbitrary-shaped envelope waveforms via phase modulation upon receiving an external trigger with minimal latency for advanced closed-loop studies (compatible with all our EEG and MRI filters)
- the TIP V3.0 temporal interference modeling tool for personalized stimulation planning with TIBS-R
- how you can use Sim4Life to advance patient-specific neural stimulation and sensing with ease through *in silico* modeling
- how Sim4Life automated workflows significantly reduce R&D time and costs
- how your innovation benefits from using the gold standard of high-resolution neuro-functionalized anatomical models or image-based modeling techniques already implemented in Sim4Life

Don't miss the poster presentations from the [IT'IS Foundation](https://itis.swiss), who will share the latest research findings:
