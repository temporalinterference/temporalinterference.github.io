# New Project MRIcompLEAD

TI Solutions is part of the Innosuisse project â€œMRIcompLEAD". The project aims to develop novel leads for applications involving neurostimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goal is to significantly outperform current solutions in terms of MRI-safety (no heating effects), MRI-compatibility (no imaging artifacts) and mechanical stability. The project officially starts on February 1, 2023.
