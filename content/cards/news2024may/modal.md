# TI Solutions and ZMT Exhibit at Brain Stimulation 2025

TI Solutions and [Z43](https://z43.swiss) partner [ZMT](https://zmt.swiss) are excited to present their latest neuromodulation and simulation tools at the upcoming [6th Brain Stimulation Conference](https://www.elsevier.com/events/conferences/all/international-brain-stimulation-conference) in Kobe, Japan, February 23 – 26, 2025. In addition, experts of the [IT’IS Foundation](https://itis.swiss) will present their latest research.

## Booth #23+24  
Meet us at Booth #23+24 for a demonstration of
- the TIBS-R V3.2 neuromodulation device, now with enhanced trigger functionality, enabling delivery of arbitrary-shaped envelope waveforms via phase modulation upon receiving an external trigger with minimal latency for advanced closed-loop studies (compatible with all our EEG and MRI filters)
- the TIP V3.0 temporal interference modeling tool for personalized stimulation planning with TIBS-R
- how you can use Sim4Life to advance patient-specific neural stimulation and sensing with ease through in silico modeling
- how Sim4Life automated workflows significantly reduce R&D time and costs
- how your innovation benefits from using the gold standard of high-resolution neuro-functionalized anatomical models or image-based modeling techniques already implemented in Sim4Life


## Breakfast Workshop  
### Tuesday, February 25, 7:30 – 8:30 hrs, Reception Hall  

Join our Breakfast Workshop "From Exposure Physics to Physiology: Next-Generation Neuromodulation Research with Sim4Life":
- Discover how integrating exposure physics with neurophysiology is key for realistic modeling and simulation in the fast-moving field of neuromodulation.
- Explore real-world examples of personalized approaches, safety assessments, and the development of novel stimulation paradigms, and learn how automated workflows can cut down on R&D time and costs.
