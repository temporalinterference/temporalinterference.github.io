The core of TIBS-R is the Intelligent Current Source with unique specifications that can be connected to 3rd-party electrodes via an Electrode Connection Box (ECB) and controlled by a computer (PC) via an Application Programming Interface (API).

The highly flexible scripting interface is available in Python and MATLAB (other languages on request). A basic graphical user interface (GUI) is available from 3rd-party sources. Customized GUIs can be developed using the scripting API. 

The TIBS-R is battery powered and electrically isolated, in compliance with the relevant standards. Optical links connect it to the PC and to peripherals like triggers for synchronization with EEG and other instruments. All pertinent information, including stimulation protocol, currents, voltages, impedances and events, are continuously recorded and displayed to the researcher.
