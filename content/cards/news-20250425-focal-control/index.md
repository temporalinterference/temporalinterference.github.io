title: New Paper "Focal Control of Non-Invasive Deep Brain Stimulation Using Multipolar Temporal Interference"

April 25, 2025

Temporal interference stimulation works by applying high-frequency currents via skin electrodes to non-invasively stimulate deep regions of the brain. A recent paper reports the use of multiple carrier frequencies targeting the same region to achieve higher intensity and improved focality. The authors refer to this TI variant as multipolar temporal interference (mTI).

In their study, the authors combined multiple electrode channels and different carrier frequencies (in the range between 975 – 4025 Hz) to create several overlapping amplitude-modulated fields. Rather than using one envelope as in standard TI, this allowed them to control the size and location of the stimulated area more precisely while keeping unwanted side effects – such as scalp sensations or off-target brain stimulation – to a minimum.

Validated in both mice and rhesus macaques, mTI successfully evoked neural activity in deep and small brain structures, such as the superior colliculus, without measurable discomfort or behavioral side effects. The method scales well across different brain sizes and shows promise for both future clinical applications and neuroscience research.

Our TIBS-R system is designed to allow any TI variants, including mTI:
- 8 fully differential, synchronized channels
- frequencies from direct current (DC) up to 100 kHz
- advanced waveform control, including phase modulation
- high precision and synchronization and software integration with Python and MATLAB
- EEG & fMRI compatibility, including closed-loop applications
