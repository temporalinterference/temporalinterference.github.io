Temporal interference (TI) is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation whereby transcutaneous electrodes are used to allow targeting and modulation of deeper brain structures not normally associated with non-invasive simulation, while avoiding unwanted stimulation of shallower cortical structures. The properties of TI have been previously demonstrated, however, the problem of decoupling stimulation focality from stimulation intensity has not yet been well addressed. This paper provides a possible novel solution, multipolar TI (mTI), which allows increased independent control over both the size of the stimulated region and the stimulation intensity. With the mTI method, multiple carrier frequencies are used to create multiple overlapping amplitude-modulated envelopes, rather than using one envelope as in standard TI. This study presents an explanation of the concept of mTI along with experimental data gathered from mice and rhesus macaques. The focality at depth in anesthetized mice and monkeys was improved, and – using the new focality in awake monkeys – targeted activity at depth in the superior colliculus was evoked. The mTI method could be an interesting and potentially useful new tool to apply alongside other forms of non-invasive brain stimulation.

Electric field simulations in this work were performed on the Sim4Life platform (ZMT Zurich MedTech AG) using the ‘stationary current solver, to model TI stimulation. A generic model of a rhesus macaque including over 350 different tissues was used from the IT’IS ViZoo database. The conductivities of the homogenous tissues were assigned according to IT’IS’s database of tissue properties. IT’IS mechanistic research and computational modeling (validated in the present study through in vivo recordings) was fundamental in optimizing the stimulation conditions, achieving the necessary focality, and interpreting results.

The scientific and technical impact of the study can be summarized as:

The use of multiple, well selected current channels and carrier frequencies to generate overlapping amplitude-modulated envelopes in mTI enables improved focality without compromising deep brain stimulation intensity
The stimulation produced with mTI – by reducing the amplitude of each contributing envelope while maintaining the overall envelope amplitude at the target but varying off-target exposure – confines the effective stimulation to a smaller brain region and avoids unwanted off-target effects and scalp sensations
The improved focality of mTI was validated in non-human primates as well as in mice, indicating that the method scales well across different brain sizes and anatomical geometries, suggesting potential for both preclinical research and clinical translation
mTI was used to successfully evoke targeted neural activity in the superior colliculus, a deep brain structure critical for eye motion control, in awake primates without behavioral side effects or evidence of discomfort (e.g., scalp twitches, or blinking responses)
