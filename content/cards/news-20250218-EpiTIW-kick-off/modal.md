# Kick-Off of Collaborative Project on TI Stimulation in Epilepsy

Last week, members of Z43 partner IT’IS Foundation, together with the teams at Ghent University’s 4BRAIN Lab and the Center for Care & Cure Technology Eindhoven, gathered in Ghent, Belgium, to officially kick-off the project “Minimally Invasive Targeting of Deep Brain Structures to Treat Epilepsy Using Temporal Interference Stimulation”. The [project](https://itis.swiss/s/news-events/research-projects/research-projects/minimally-invasive-targeting-of-deep-brain-structures-to-treat-epilepsy-using-temporal-interference-stimulation) is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen (FWO), under the funding scheme [Weave](https://www.snf.ch/en/CxcoLbDNRaUwHIoH/funding/projects/weave), a cross-European initiative in support of cross-border collaborative research projects.

The aim of this project is to establish the foundation for a new paradigm for the use of TI stimulation in the treatment of epilepsy. To achieve this ambitious goal, the consortium combines expertise in (i) TI stimulation hardware design, (ii) computational electromagnetic dosimetry, (iii) neuromodulation modeling, (iv) in vitro and in vivo rodent-model experiments, (v) electrophysiology recordings, and (vi) whole brain imaging. The consortium will leverage the {{< modal-link TIBS-R-system >}}TIBS-R system{{< /modal-link >}}  for this project.
