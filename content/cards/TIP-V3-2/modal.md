# TIP V3.0

## Temporal Interference Planning Tool of IT'IS
The Temporal Interference Planning (TIP) tool Version 3.0 of the [IT'IS Foundation](https://itis.swiss) developed for TIBS-R provides an advanced modeling pipeline for electrode placement and stimulation targeting with the TIBS-R system, offering cloud-based simulations and interactive visualizations.

{{< /modal-image >}}

Incorporate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data for individualized results, using automatic image processing to create tissue models with isotropic or anisotropic conductivity for simulations.

## Electromagnetic Simulations
