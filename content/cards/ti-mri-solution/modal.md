# TI-MRI Filter Solutions

## TI-MRI Filter Solutions of the IT'IS Foundation
The unique TI-MRI Filter Solutions of the IT'IS Foundation [IT'IS Foundation](https://itis.swiss) allow for artifact-free concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recording during temporal interference (TI) stimulation with our TIBS-R system.  

The TI protocol is conveniently operated from the PC in the MRI control room, where the TIBS-R is also located. The standard Electrode Connection Box (ECB) is replaced with an fMRI-compatible version supplied by IT’IS. Stimulation currents are delivered to the ECB, positioned near the subject’s head, through a filter integrated into the shielded room’s penetration panel and delivered via a 10-meter cable equipped with traps tuned to the scanner’s specific radiofrequency (RF) frequency.  

An additional breakthrough is the set of leads developed by TI Solutions in collaboration with EMPA [EMPA](https://www.empa.ch/web/empa/), Switzerland, featuring optimized distributed resistance for maximum safety and artifact-free recording during fMRI. TIBS-R supports up to four stimulation channels (eight electrodes).
