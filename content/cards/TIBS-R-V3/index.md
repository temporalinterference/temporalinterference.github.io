Temporal interference (TI) stimulation is a non-invasive technique that uses overlapping electrical fields to modulate activity of deep brain targets. The Temporal Interference Brain Stimulator for Research (TIBS-R) is the leading technology for research and clinical studies using this innovative approach.

The device supports up to 8 synchronous stimulation channels, a broad carrier frequency range (DC – 100 kHz), and modulation from sinusoidal to arbitrary waveforms. With external trigger synchronization, compatibility with electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging recordings, and unmatched flexibility, it is the ideal device for highly controlled TI stimulation.
