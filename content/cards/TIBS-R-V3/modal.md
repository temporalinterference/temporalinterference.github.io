# TIBS-R System

At the core of TIBS-R is the Intelligent Current Source (ICS) with unique specifications that can be connected to 3rd-party electrodes via an Electrode Connection Box and controlled by a computer (PC) via an Application Programming Interface. Highly flexible scripting interfaces in multiple languages (e.g., Python, MATLAB) and custom-specific graphical user interfaces are widely available from 3rd party sources. Optical inputs and outputs are available for synchronization with external triggers, e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG) instruments. TIBS-R is electrically isolated and compliant with the relevant standards. 
All pertinent information, including stimulation protocol, currents, voltages, impedances, inputs, etc., is continuously recorded and displayed to the researchers. Any malfunction is automatically detected and puts the device in a non-stimulating state that requires self-validation before stimulation can be continued.
Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recording during TI stimulation requires the TI-EEG Solution that includes a high-pass filter piggybacked to the ECB and an EEG system-specific filter before the EEG amplifiers. 
Concurrent fMRI requires special resistive electrodes and a different ECB.
