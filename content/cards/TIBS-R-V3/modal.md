# TIBS-R V3.2

The Temporal Interference Brain Stimulator for Research (TIBS-R) is the leading technology for research and clinical studies on non-invasive TI stimulation of deep brain targets. It supports up to 8 synchronous stimulation channels, a broad carrier frequency range (DC – 100 kHz), and modulation from sinusoidal to arbitrary waveforms. With external trigger synchronization, compatibility with electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging recordings, and unmatched flexibility, it is the ideal device for highly controlled TI stimulation.
